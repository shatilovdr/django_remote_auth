# ft_transcendence Project Overview


## Issue Management 📝
- For any future tasks, bugs, or issues you can't fix immediately, **create a new issue** to track them.

## Branching Strategy 🚀

This project follows a structured Git workflow. All changes pass through the `dev` branch before merging into `main`.

### 1. **Main Branch (`main`)** 🌟
- Contains stable, tested code.
- Merge into `main` only after testing in `dev`.

### 2. **Development Branch (`dev`)** 🔧
- All features/updates are merged into `dev` first.
- Create feature/bugfix branches from `dev`.

### 3. **Feature/Hotfix Branches** 🌱
- Branch naming convention:
  - `feature/<feature-name>`
  - `bugfix/<issue-description>`
- After local testing, merge back into `dev`.

### 4. **Merging to Main** ✅
- Once tested in `dev`, create a pull request to merge into `main`.

### Workflow:
- `dev` → `feature/awesome-feature` → Develop → Test → Merge into `dev` → Merge `dev` into `main`.
